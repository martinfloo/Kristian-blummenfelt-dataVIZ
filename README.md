# Kristian-blummenfelt-dataVIZ

This notebook was created to delve into the dataset published by entalpi, Kristian Blummenfelt, and his team's company. The dataset encompasses Kristian Blummenfelt's remarkable marathon performance, securing third place in the KONA Ironman World Championship.

Information about the dataset can be found here: https://github.com/entalpi-no/kona-2022

The objective behind this exploration was driven purely by a interest in sports science and his performance. The team utilizes a lot of sensors, providing a valuable resource for post-race analysis and insights. Throughout this project, I endeavored to present potentially valuable insights derived from this dataset.

Future works:
In future iterations, I plan to develop generalized functions that can produce a similar comprehensive report focusing on Gustav Idens' performance as well. This expansion aims to broaden our understanding and insights into marathon performances, aiding in further analysis and improvements.This notebook was created to explore the dataset published by entalpi, Kristian Blummenfelt and his teams company.
